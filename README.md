It is a online hotel booking website. I tried to take ideas from the website and created a bit different website.
I have used HTML, CSS and JS for this project.For storage purpose i used localStorage. I basically added two locations in my database(local storage) that are, Kolkata and Bangalore.

if you search by this the result would be shown and u can reserve hotel by clicking the reverse hotel button and only then the hotel details page would be updated.Inside you can choose a room that you like. 

In the end the price would be calculated as normal hotel price + rooms that you have added.

It has option of adding card details and once you fill all the fields and click on complete booking then you are good to go.
